I am a recent graduate who loves technology and problem solving.

## Objective

I started in Computer Science where I developed a skill in coding, but eventually found a passion for Cybersecurity through cracking systems and understanding networks. I am very eager to continue cultivating my skills and transition into this field, specififcally aiming to join as a Cybersecurity Analyst and then become a Penetration Tester.
